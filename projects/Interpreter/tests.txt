Works
Factorial

(define (fac n) (if (b= 0 n) 1 (b* n (fac (b- n 1)))))
(fac 4)
24
(fac 10)
3628800

Does not work
Maybe scope is wrong. Maybe function?? Could be the b< or b- as b+ seems 
to work.
Fibonacci

(define (fib n) (if (b< n 2) n (b+ (fib (b- n 1)) (fib (b- n 2)))))   
(fib 2)
0
(fib 10)
-80

Works
Doubles x each pass.

(define double (lambda (x) (b+ x x)))
(double (double (double 2)))
16
(double (double (double 3)))
24

--

Works
Doubles x once and then squares that number.
(define sqr (lambda (x) (b* x x)))
(sqr (sqr (sqr (sqr (double 1)))))
65536
(sqr (sqr (double 3)))
1296

Does not work

(define (make-stream n f)
