CSC 4101 Project 2 TODOs: (X = done or good enough...)

  1. (write) is is evaluating and not just pretty printing

  2. (read) is currently taking the 1st arg and dropping it in Regular. It keeps
     it for the 2nd though.

  3. (display) is not currently working? (does same as write)

  4. (apply) is not currently working

  5. (interaction-environment) does something - not sure if correct though

X 6. asking for a list (after having defined it) returns "error: bad quote
     printing on my part" for each element in the list

  7. (set-car!) sets the car to () instead of the given value

  8. several things (cdr, cons, set-car!, set-cdr!, etc.) go to pretty
     printer by default (e.g. (cdr '(a b c)) should be '(b c) / without
     pretty printer spacing)  

  9. defining something to an existing function prints placeholder twice
     (e.g. (define + b+), + = placeholder \n placeholder, (+ 2 2) = 4)
     (scheme48 prints #{Procedure <some#> double} - placeholder will be 
     fine if it is made to only print once)

X 10. (symbol?) and (number?) return "#f" for undefined variable queries
       (should only return "undefined variable")

X 11. 'a returns a (should return 'a) and "a" returns a (should be "a")

X 12. make ,exit work? or just stick with the current (quit) and (exit)?
